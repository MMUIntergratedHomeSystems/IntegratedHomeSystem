# Integrated Home System
MMU - The Intelligent Home Group Project 2015/16

## Synopsis
The core concept of using technology in the home to improve quality of life has become very important, and with the enhancement of technology and the idea of the Internet of things, this has become much easier. The Internet of things follows the ideology of having to control “Smart Devices” around the house with only a button click or by using the web interface, if the user is away. Integrated Home Systems (IHS) is a further enhancement to the same concept. Along with the use of prototyping technologies and agile methodology IHS will also be designed to be voice assessable and be more context aware.
